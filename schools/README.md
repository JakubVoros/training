## New York high school's SAT score
### Basic data cleaning and a few basic analysis

We are working with several different files containing informations about high schools from New York and their students.

The aim is to explore, clean the data and make a few basic analysis. And the main focus is on the topic if SAT scores (standardized tests) are unfair to certain groups of students. 

Working requirements:

Python 3
JupyterNotebook
Libraries from requirements.txt

If you don't want to run the code yourself, but still would like to see the whole code with functional maps, graphs etc. you can see it here:
